      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I observe real-word users interacting with an interface
        of my choosing and then, with my findings, create two personas and 
        paring storyboards encapsulating the personalities and behaviors of the
        observed users.
      </p>
      <h3>The Interface: A Keyboard</h3>
      <p>
        The interface I chose for this project was the keyboard. Specifically,
        I chose to  observe users only using the keyboards found on MacBook
        laptops. This has the benefits of a standard keyboard layout between
        users, as well as provide an abundance of potential users to observe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The keyboard itself is made up of rows of keys (buttons) that can print
        text, to the screen, remove text from the screen and control other
        functions of the laptop such as changing the brightness of the screen or
        shutting down the computer altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the keys have labels indicating their purpose. All of the keys
        are labeled to inform the user of the possible functionalities. The keys
        can be pressed individually to perform a function or can be pressed in
        combination with other keys.
      </p>

      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <p>
        I observed three users, all Brown students using their keyboards for
        different tasks
      </p>
      <ul id="users">
        <li id="user-1">
          <h3>User 1</h3>
          <h4><em>Computer Science</em></h4>
          <p class="user-description">
            This user was programming. The programs they were using were VS Code
            and Google Chrome.
          </p>
          <ul class="notes">
            <li>This user made frequent user of keyboard shortcuts</li>
            <li>
              This user's function keys acted like a Windows computer. Meaning
              that F5 reloaded the web browser page and F12 brought up the
              browser development tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              This user never used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right
              side of the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              This user used keyboard shortcuts to achieve what most users will
              do with a track pad. This includes using a shortcut to select
              large blocks of text and a shortcut to change the active window
              between VS Code and Google Chrome.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <h3>User 2</h3>
          <h4><em>Anthropology</em></h4>
          <p class="user-description">
            This user was writing an essay. They were using Google Docs and Adobe Acrobat
          </p>

              This user never used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right side of the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              This user did not use keyboard shortcuts. When they needed to change the font from
              normal to bold, select the text they needed to change and then click on the bold
              button on the top of page using the track pad.
            </li>
            <li>This user did not use the function keys.</li>

          <h3>User 3</h3>
          <h4> <em>International and Public Affairs</em></h4>
          <p class="user-description">
            This user was taking notes. They were using Google Docs

            <li>
              This user never used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right side of the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              This user typed fast but not accurately. There were many misspellings in their notes.
            </li>
            <li>This user never used the track pad.</li>
            <li>
              This user used (CMD + B) and (CMD + I) keyboard shortcuts to bold an italicized text.
            </li>
            <li>
              This user's function keys perform different actions than User 1. The keys did what was
              indicated on the label (change brightness, adjust volume, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              This user typed with two fingers.
            </li>

          None of the users used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right side of the keyboard.

          The function keys performed different actions between users.

      <h2>Question Responses</h2>
      <details class="question">
        <summary>
          1. When do you use the function keys on your keyboard, if at all?
        </summary>
        <ul class="responses">
          <li>
            One user recently migrated to a MacBook from a Windows laptop and
            changed the default function key behavior in their settings to mimic
            the Windows behavior. Some of the changes include F5 being used to
            refresh the current browsing window and F12 bringing up the dev
            tools for the current browsing window.
          </li>
          <li>
            One user uses the default configuration for the function keys. They
            use the keys to change the screen brightness, adjust the volume,
            etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            One user does not use the function keys at all.

      <details class="question">
        <summary>
          2. What do you think of the shift, command, and options keys on the right
          side of your keyboard?
        </summary>
        <ul class="responses">
          <li>
            All users do not use these keys
          </li>
          <li>
            One user suggested that they be configured to some other
            functionality such as navigating to the last opened page in the
            current browsing window tab or return to the "New Tab" launch screen
            instead of having to open a new tab to get back to that screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            One user suggested that these keys instead be used to start and end
            different "work modes". When you press a key, a set of predefined
            applications would open that correspond to that mode, and all other
            widows would close.
          </li>
          <li>
            One user suggested that these keys be removed to simplify the
            keyboard.

          3. Is there a character or a command that you feel like should have its 
          own key?
        </summary>
        <ul class="responses">
          <li>
            One user likes to differentiate between text and code in their notes
            by changing fonts. This user suggested that there be a key that
            allows for a quick change between two fonts when typing.
          </li>
          <li>
            One user wished that there was a key, or that they could set an existing
            key, to open a blank note in their favorite note taking app so they
            spend less time opening the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            One user wished that there was a key that brought up a list of
            different characters from other alphabets so they could more easily
            insert these characters into their documents.

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        From the user observations, I have devised two personas: 
        <em>Simple Sally</em> and <em>Speed Demon Dave</em>
      </p>
      <div class="container">

          <h3>Simple Sally</h3>
          <img src="./assets/persona_simple_sally.jpg" alt="simple sally persona diagram">
          <figcaption>
            Figure 1: Simple Sally is a Brown student who feels like computers
            are too complicated. She prefers GUIs to keyboard shortcuts to
            perform certain actions.
          </figcaption>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Simple Sally does not want to overwhelm herself learning the
            shortcuts for all of the applications she uses. In all possible
            cases, this user performs actions using GUIs provided by the
            application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sally faces the issues of an overly-complicated keyboard for her
            purposes. She finds little use for right-side option, command,
            shift keys, and function keys. Consequently, Sally feels that the
            keyboard would be better off without them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sally is based on <a href="#user-2">User 2</a>. Like Sally, User
            2 does not use the functions keys or the right-side command, option,
            or shift keys. Also like Sally, User 2 felt like the keyboard layout
            could be simplified to remove keys that they believe are rarely used.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <figure id="speed-demon-dave">
          <h3>Speed Demon Dave</h3>
          <img src="./assets/persona_speed_demon_dave.jpg" alt="speed demon dave persona diagram">
          <figcaption>
            Figure 2: Speed Demon Dave is a Brown student who wants to maximize
            his productivity. He tries to learn every shortcut for every
            application and even changes his keyboard's default settings to
            fit his preferences.
          </figcaption>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Speed Demon Dave does not want to waste time shuffling through GUI
            menus. He learns every shortcut and keybinding so he can maximize
            his output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dave is based on <a href="#user-1">User 1</a> and 
            <a href="#user-3">User 3</a>. Like User 1, Dave uses may keyboard
            shortcuts that most users might not even know about. Such as
            CMD + TAB to change the active application. Also like how User 1
            changed their function keys, Dave configures the keys on his
            keyboard to fit his personal workflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like User 3, Dave does not use the track pad, preferring to do as
            much as possible on the keyboard. Also like User 3, Dave is fast but
            not 100% accurate. He would like there to be a way to bind a key,
            perhaps one of the right-side command, option, or shift keys, to
            some behavior that might increase his accuracy.
